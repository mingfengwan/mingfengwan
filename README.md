- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ming
- Profile pending
- I occasionally write [tech blogs for my company](https://explorerhop.com/blogs/tech).
- I built a [free Shopify booking app](https://apps.shopify.com/calendar-booking) and a [free Shopify currency conversion app](https://apps.shopify.com/currency-hop).
- And here's a [mildly interesting paper](https://doi.org/10.1515/lingvan-2023-0051), or a [mildly interesting video](https://youtube.com/shorts/Igx-Dl3NIPU?feature=share).
